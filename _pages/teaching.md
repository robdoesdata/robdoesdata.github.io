I have developed an extensive track record of teaching across all levels from primary education through to postgraduate level across a wide range of subjects. I have 4 years of experience teaching and marking undergraduate Mathematics courses (numerical methods, applied mathematical methods and Cosmology) and spent 1 year teaching Linux and Computational Methods at postgraduate level. I worked full time as a private tutor for students who struggled with mainstream education from 2021 to 2023, covering Mathematics, Sciences, English, Economics and History at KS2, KS3, GCSE and A-level. 

**My teaching ethos is built on the concept of teaching to understand and not to memorise**. While simple, this is often overlooked in classroom environments. As a private tutor I worked on a 1-to-1 or 2-to-1 basis which allowed me to tailor my lesson plans to each student's learning style and to implement alternative teaching approaches, e.g. interactive learning activities or iterative whiteboard activities. This approached allowed me to inspire and build confidence in my students whilst improving they're grades and attitude to learning.
