    <p>I can generate structured and unstructured datasets which mimic real data - these could be numerical values, mulitlingual text, or even multimedia files such as image and audio. These datasets can be used to aid development of proof-of-concept capabilities, training machine learning models or even test the functionality of new software.</p>
