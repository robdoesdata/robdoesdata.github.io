# About me!
Hi, I'm Rob (also known as @RobDoesData) and this is my first blog post! I am currently working in the UK defence sector in the fuzzy overlapping zone of data engineering and data analytics. I specialise in developing proof-of-concept demonstrations covering all aspects of data and AI by using a combination of Python, PowerBI, and most recently, Microsoft Azure. Before this I worked in academia where my research focused on geophysical and astrophysical fluid dynamics, more specifically developing simulations of Earth's core.

# Where did it all begin? 
Back in my school days, I was just never really that into it and left school when I was a teenager with no qualifications. When I was around 16 I decided to go back into education to obtain my GCSEs at the local college and this is where I found my passion for maths and problem solving. Fast forward 6 years and I had completed my GCSEs, my A-levels, a Bachelor's degree in Applied Maths and Theoretical Physics, and was just starting an integrated Masters and Ph.D. in Fluid Dynamics. For my master's project, I investigated flood management by combining a tabletop demonstration model with a numerical algorithm I had developed to describe river flow. I used the demonstration at various public outreach events to engage and educate the general public on the science of extreme weather events and flooding. During my PhD work, I got to run supercomputer simulations solving the equations describing fluid flow and publish my work in leading academic journals. As an added bonus, I got to travel all over the world presenting my work at conferences, spent a summer as a visiting researcher at UCLA, and won a prestigious presentation award in San Francisco. I am very passionate about science communication and have been involved in various outreach events in which I took technical concepts and made them accessible to a general audience.

# So how did I get into data?
Post covid, I didn't know what I was going to do for work but knew that it was time to go into industry. While I hadn't had any formal education in computer science, I had been responsible for managing my own data during my academic research (at the time I didn't know what ETL was but I had been doing it) and built my own machine learning and data visualisation tools in Python. Data science and data engineering seemed like a logical fit so I took the plunge and just a year later I am leading small teams of data analysts. I have had a blast over the last year, rapidly developing my knowledge of databases, AI, and cloud/platform engineering.

# Why did I start this blog?
My journey to becoming a data professional is quite unique and I often approach things differently to my peers. I think there may be value in sharing my thoughts on various topics covering data and AI as I do have a different view and approach to problem-solving. It may take a while for me to find my blogging style but I hope you bear with me! Hopefully, you will find some of my future posts of interest and engaging enough to contact me!
